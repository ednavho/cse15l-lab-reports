# Edna's Lab Report 4 Week 8

For the past few weeks, we've been looking into testing our code with JUnit tests and debugging according to any error messages. For MarkdownParse, I have my own implementation as well as another peer's implementation. We'll be testing each implementation with given test files to see if our implementations account for the situations.

## **Test Snippet 1**

- The expected output should be:

    ```[`google.com, google.com, ucsd.edu]```
    
- The test in MarkdownParseTest.java should look like this:

![myimptest1](myimptest1.png)

- The corresponding output when running the JUnit test with my implementation:

![myimptest1output](myimpytest1output.png)

- The corresponding output when running the JUnit test with my peer's implementation:

![bellatest1output](bellatest1output.png)
