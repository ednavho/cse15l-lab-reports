# Edna's Lab Report 4 Week 8

For the past few weeks, we've been looking into testing our code with JUnit tests and debugging according to any error messages. For MarkdownParse, I have my own implementation as well as another peer's implementation. We'll be testing each implementation with given test files to see if our implementations account for the situations.
